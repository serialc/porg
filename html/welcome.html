                        <p>
                        The productivity open research group (PORG) is a monthly brown bag (lunchtime) meeting that invites participants to informally present and discuss <strong>how</strong> they perform effective research (or work) using their tools, such as, preferably, free/open software.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        In conventional computer-dependent research work-spaces, efficient research or general productivity, typically means the use of software, configurations, or other tools, that ease processing or task completiong, or, increasingly, prevent distraction.
                        PORG is about sharing what software, libraries, modules, packages, configurations, or other such 'software' you use, and helping others or learning of better alternatives.
                        PORG is all about <strong>the how</strong> and not <em>the why or the topic</em> of application.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The internet, its content, and search has increasingly become overrun with low quality or superficial content combined with advertising.
                        How are we to find effective tools in this sea of poor or biased information with largely market solutions seek to monitor or entrench you in their system?
                        Alternatives exist in the domain of free and open software.
                        <strong>Yet finding helpful suggestions for good software or practices has become difficult.</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        PORG provides a monthly opportunity for an informal social meeting for individuals to share research experiences and recommendations regarding, mainly, open/free software, good practices, and other relevent aspects.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        PORG is an inclusive and welcoming professional association. We welcome members of Belval research institutes to from all domains to come and share, whether it be about a better citation manager, or VIM plugins.
