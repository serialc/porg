The productivity open research group (PORG) is a monthly brown bag (lunchtime) meeting that invites participants to present and discusses how they perform research productively.

In conventional computational-dependent research work-spaces, efficient research or general productivity typically means selecting software, hardware, configurations, or other tricks.

The internet, content and search, has increasingly become overrun with low quality or superficial content combined with advertising. In this sea of poor information and many market soutions that may be inferior or equilent to open and free alternatives, finding helpful advice, behaviours, and software becomes difficult.

PORG provides a social and expert meeting group to share research experiences and recommendations regarding open software, practices, and other aspects.

PORT is an inclusive and welcoming association.
