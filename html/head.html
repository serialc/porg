                        <h2>Why PORG?</h2>
                        <p>
                        The productivity open research group (PORG) is a monthly brown bag (lunchtime) meeting that invites participants to informally present and discuss how they perform effective research (or work) using free/open software.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        In conventional computer-dependent research work-spaces, efficient research or general productivity, typically means the use of software, or configurations, that ease our processes, or increasingly, prevent distraction. What software, libraries, modules, packages, configurations, or other such 'software' do you use that may be of use to others?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The internet, its content, and search has increasingly become overrun with low quality or superficial content combined with advertising. In this sea of poor information and many proposed market solutions are many alternatives to free and open software. These however may be inferior, equivalent, or, more likely, seek to monitor or entrench you in their system.
                        <strong>Finding helpful suggestions for good software or practices has become difficult.</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        PORG provides a monthly opportunity for an informal social meeting for individuals to share research experiences and recommendations regarding open/free software, good practices, and other relevent aspects.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        PORG is an inclusive and welcoming professional association.
                        </p>
