## How do you create reports, presentations, and academic papers?

Why, with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) of course.

Quarto is an "An open-source scientific and technical publishing system".

In simple terms Quarto allows you to write content using a simple text editor with some special syntax (a revised version of Markdown - with files using the extension *.qmd) and then decide how you wish to share or export the content. Quarto can create a PDF, website, presentations, books, journal articles, or Word documents.

Rather than use costly and proprietary programs like Microsoft Word, you can use a free IDE such as RStudio. The name 'RStudio' may confuse or scare people (those who know that R is a programming language), but RStudio is also just a text editor that makes publishing with Quarto really easy.

Some people, who aren't bothered by proprietary software, prefer to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) by Microsoft.

I've been using RStudio to create presentations (e.g. [Inkscape](https://serialc.github.io/inkscape_poster_making_tutorial/inkscape_poster_making_tutorial.html#1)) but will try using Quarto next time.

Similarly, I have used TexMaker, a front-end for using latex, to create my publications. However, it's also possible to link my citations (*.bib) files from RStudio in a Quarto article, it actually will just use the same latex generator (e.g. pdflatex) in the back end if I wish to generate a PDF.

Quarto looks pretty great. It looks to be a centralized mean of doing all content creation and publishing.

## Github Pages

While many people use Github to backup and work concurrently with the versioning system, it also provides the ability to host a website. So you can host your [personal blog](https://ginolhac.github.io/), an [individual project](https://serialc.github.io/rusttrian/), or an [index of projects](https://serialc.github.io/).

Github (and Gitlab) has other benefits, it can be used to also run tests on your code on commit. More details on this next.

Do note that Github is operated by Microsoft.

## Continuous integration

> Continuous integration (CI) is a software practice that requires frequently committing code to a shared repository. Committing code more often detects errors sooner and reduces the amount of code a developer needs to debug when finding the source of an error
