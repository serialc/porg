# PORG #3

## How do you create reports, presentations, and academic papers?

Why, with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) of course.

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/about.html) is an "An open-source scientific and technical publishing system" based on [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
The latter written in Haskell convert tons of format into another. Quarto helps and enhance those convertions.

In simple terms Quarto allows you to write content using a simple text editor with some special syntax (a revised version of Markdown - with files using the extension *.qmd and variables specified in a `yaml` _header_) and then decide how you wish to share or export the content. Quarto can create a PDF, website, presentations, books, journal articles, or Word documents.

Rather than use costly and proprietary programs like Microsoft Word, you can use a free IDE such as RStudio. The name 'RStudio' may confuse or scare people (those who know that R is a programming language), but RStudio is also just a text editor that makes publishing with Quarto really easy.

Some people, who aren't bothered by proprietary software, prefer to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) by Microsoft. Of an open source **VScode** without the MS layer exists: [**Code OSS**](https://flathub.org/apps/com.visualstudio.code-oss) at least for GNU/Linux.

I've been using RStudio to create presentations (e.g. [Inkscape](https://serialc.github.io/inkscape_poster_making_tutorial/inkscape_poster_making_tutorial.html#1)) but will try using Quarto next time.

Similarly, I have used TexMaker, a front-end for using latex, to create my publications. However, it's also possible to link my citations (*.bib) files from RStudio in a Quarto article, it actually will just use the same latex generator (e.g. pdflatex) in the back end if I wish to generate a PDF.

Quarto looks pretty great. It looks to be a centralized mean of doing all content creation and publishing.

## Github Pages

While many people use Github to backup and work concurrently with the versioning system, it also provides the ability to host a website. So you can host your [personal blog](https://ginolhac.github.io/), an [individual project](https://serialc.github.io/rusttrian/), or an [index of projects](https://serialc.github.io/).

One can decide if the pages are hosted on a separate branch (`gh-pages`), on the main branch root or usually the `docs/` sub-folder.

Github (and Gitlab) has other benefits, it can be used to also run tests on your code on commit. More details on this next.

Do note that Github is operated by Microsoft.

## Continuous integration

> Continuous integration (CI) is a software practice that requires frequently committing code to a shared repository. Committing code more often detects errors sooner and reduces the amount of code a developer needs to debug when finding the source of an error
(Source: [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration))

[GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration) allow continuous integration (GitHub calls it GitHub Actions).

As described in the quote above, CI lets you do a variety of 'actions' when an event, such as a commit, occurs. This should help catch errors sooner, particularly when collaborating, but it can do a variety of other tasks as well.

### Gitlab

Gitlab CI are explicit `dind` meaning **docker-in-docker**. The CI is a docker process that build a docker image that is then used for the different steps. Once built the image is cached, but also one can define a cache for the R/Python packages that are used during a building step. A classic workflow tha is a smart Makefile is:

- Build the docker image, only is the `Dockerfile` is modified
- Render a Quarto project for every commit using the image of the previous step:
    + Sync the packages with `renv` (using a cache between jobs)
    + Render documents that were modified (cache involved)
- Publish the static web on Gitlab Pages from the previous step (explicit dependency).

And example of such a workflow can be seen in this [post](https://ginolhac.github.io/posts/2023-09-14_renv-python-ci/).

### Github Actions

The rationale is the same except that most actions work with recipes. It is more compact but less clear. Plus you depend on others who develop those recipes. See an example of workflow for [rendering a Quarto extension](https://github.com/ginolhac/unilu-theme/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml) which:

- Use cache and `renv`
- Render the Quarto template
- Publish the rendered HTML to the `gh-pages`

Cons of Github Actions for this example:

- No `Dockerfile`, it is somehow one based on latest Ubuntu and install of some libdev but you cannot use it with Docker, so local tests are not possible
- The number of builds for free are limited
- For the `gh-pages` it is all automated in this one liner `uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2` but was hard to tests and you must run manually `quarto publish gh-pages` locally.

## PyCharm... moving to VS Code?

Do you use PyCharm? I did, perhaps a decade ago when it resembled more what iPython is today. It's changed a lot to fully fledged IDE. It provides many of the same functionalities as VS Code... so is it worthwhile moving to VS Code?

The problem seems to be collaboration. With many people now using VS Code, sharing projects from PyCharm to VS Code adds some complexity.

Of note, VScode has many amazing [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode). For example `Remote SSH`, or `CSV Lint` are amazing and having them in RStudio would be great.

What are some strategies or tools that make this easier? If you have any thoughts come to our next PORG meeting.
