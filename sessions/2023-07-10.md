# Summary of first PORG

## Introduction 

### What is PORG

PORG is a monthly meeting where poeple share **how** they accomplish certain tasks.
The purpose is to allow participants to either learn and improve their method of doing similar tasks, or to share what they believe may be an alternative, or better, method of doing so.

### What's the purpose of PORG

The internet's efficiency in providing useful information is rapidly declining as search becomes cluttered by Search Engine Optimization (SEO) results of poor relevence or quality, and the many commercial offerings that are just mediocre or more interested in your data than the servie they propose.

It takes time for people to learn about the limitations of commercial software.
Eventually people discover the limitations of their software either realizing that it is difficult or impossible to extract their data, or that the program or service is more interested in their data than providing the promoted service.

Free and open source software is the best longterm solution, despite perhaps not always containing the latest, fastest, or best set of features.

While PORG focuses on free software, there exist contraints that mean we sometimes do need propriatary software. PORG welcomes discussion all methodologies/software.

## Project 1 - A basic website

The PORG website uses a simply HTML but within a PHP wrapper that determines the date of the next PORG event (2nd monday of the month except in August).

The website:
- was developed in VIM (on Ubuntu)
- uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework for responsive layout
- is backed up and synchronized between development and production using [github](https://github.com/serialc/porg)

### PHP overkill

Some feel that using PHP for such a simple application is overkill. However, the best tool for the job isn't an objective question. It's subjective, based on your experience and skills. Given my skill set the website was created in only a few hours.
PHP provides some nice time/date functions that allow easy calculation of the second Monday of the month, or next month.

```
$secmon_thismonth = (new DateTime(date('Y-m-d')))->modify('second monday of this month');
$secmon_nextmonth = (new DateTime(date('Y-m-d')))->modify('second monday of next month');
```

### Why use Ubuntu?

Like many Windows was my first operating system that I became familiar with. Macs were always the odd-ball, niche. When I tried it for the first time in 2006 I struggled finding the desired utilities and knowing how to install programs. Once I discovered the basics however I found Macs to be a much calmer experience than Windows.
There were fewer interruptions and less competition for your attention away from your desired task.

Over time however the 'walled-garden' that is the Mac operating system has become increasingly constrictive, making it a burden to install the software I wish to use.

Moving to Ubuntu, a linux distribution, has been once again a breath of fresh and calming air. I can install programs extremely easily and quickly, and make any configurations I desire. Additionally, I have returned to using the Ctrl modifier key, rather than the Mac key which I found awkward to use.
