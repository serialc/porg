# PORG #1

## Introduction 

### What is PORG

PORG is a monthly meeting where poeple share **how** they accomplish certain tasks.
The purpose is to allow participants to either learn and improve their method of doing similar tasks, or to share what they believe may be an alternative, or better, method of doing so.

### What's the purpose of PORG

The internet's efficiency in providing useful information is rapidly declining as search becomes cluttered by Search Engine Optimization (SEO) results of poor relevence or quality, and the many commercial offerings that are just mediocre or more interested in your data than the servie they propose.

It takes time for people to learn about the limitations of commercial software.
Eventually people discover the limitations of their software either realizing that it is difficult or impossible to extract their data, or that the program or service is more interested in their data than providing the promoted service.

Free and open source software is the best longterm solution, despite perhaps not always containing the latest, fastest, or best set of features.

While PORG focuses on free software, there exist contraints that mean we sometimes do need propriatary software. PORG welcomes discussion all methodologies/software.

## Project 1 - A basic website

The PORG website uses a simply HTML but within a PHP wrapper that determines the date of the next PORG event (2nd monday of the month except in August).

The website:
- was developed in VIM (on Ubuntu)
- uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework for responsive layout
- is backed up and synchronized between development and production using [github](https://github.com/serialc/porg)

### PHP overkill?

Some feel that using PHP for such a simple application is overkill. However, the best tool for the job isn't an objective question. It's subjective, based on your experience, skills, and constraints, such as the tools you can use on the target platform. Given my skill set the website was created in only a few hours.

PHP provides some nice time/date functions that allow easy calculation of the second Monday of the month, or next month:

```
$secmon_thismonth = (new DateTime(date('Y-m-d')))->modify('second monday of this month');
$secmon_nextmonth = (new DateTime(date('Y-m-d')))->modify('second monday of next month');
```

It was noted however the using PHP rather than more static/HTML content may present some security vulnerability. This is true. It's one of the compromises to make among others.

Static website generators were suggested a a good alternative.

### Alternative tools

It was mentioned that alternatives may be better, such as [Nanoc](https://nanoc.app/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I have used Hugo before a [couple](https://digilego.eu/) [times](https://frakturmedia.net/) but felt that this was overly complex... going back to that subjectivity of the best tools.

## Why use Ubuntu?

Like many Windows was my first operating system that I became familiar with. Macs were always the odd-ball, niche. When I tried it for the first time in 2006 I struggled finding the desired utilities and knowing how to install programs. Once I discovered the basics however I found Macs to be a much calmer experience than Windows.
There were fewer interruptions and less competition for your attention away from your desired task.

Over time however the 'walled-garden' that is the Mac operating system has become increasingly constrictive, making it a burden to install the software I wish to use.

Moving to Ubuntu, a linux distribution, has been once again a breath of fresh and calming air. I can install programs extremely easily and quickly, and make any configurations I desire. Additionally, I have returned to using the Ctrl modifier key, rather than the Mac key which I found awkward to use.

## The PORG mascot and Inkscape

While describing the PORG website development I described using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for the mascot image. I use Inkscape to clean up maps that I export from [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/), figures from R, or to create flyers and posters.

**Inkscape is a great vector editor** (a free alternative to Adobe Illustrator). If you'd like an introduction to using Inkscape then check out this [tutorial I created](https://digilego.eu/oer/45) ([direct link](https://serialc.github.io/inkscape_poster_making_tutorial/inkscape_poster_making_tutorial.html#1)).

## Figures and text sizes

We discussed the common problem of having text in figures match up with the document text. Many participants had some experience with LaTeX and the [xfig](https://mcj.sourceforge.net/latex_and_xfig.html) package was mentioned as a helpful tool to adapt figure text size to the document.

## Backup and synchronizing

While some people may not need to synchronize their work between multiple machines, everyone should be backing up.

For collaboration many people use [git](https://git-scm.com/) a version control system that you can use to synchronize work between computers and users. You typically have one copy of the files always online. While you could create your own instance many people use [GitHub](https://github.com/), or [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/).

The PORG site is actually developed on a laptop, syncronized with [GitHub repository](https://github.com/serialc/porg) and then synced to the server.

However this method is overly complicated for many tasks.

If you want to sync a bunch of directories across machines the most commonly used tool is the proprietary Dropbox.
Alternatives exist of course, such as Box, but with the same proprietary limitations.
The problem is that synchronizing, or backing up, requires that one machine is always one.

If you're willing to do this then you may enjoy something like [Unison](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison) or [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/). They have different benefits. Syncthing will work like Dropbox between the two machines, always trying to create identical copies on both (or multiple) machines.

Unison, as a feature, allows you to almost curate how you syncronize data between the machines. This allows you fine control and oversight of what is being backed up (or not), almost like when using git.
