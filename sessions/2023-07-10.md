# Summary of first PORG

## Introduction 

### What is PORG

PORG is a monthly meeting where poeple share **how** they accomplish certain tasks.
The purpose is to allow participants to either learn and improve their method of doing similar tasks, or to share what they believe may be an alternative, or better, method of doing so.

### What's the purpose of PORG

The internet's efficiency in providing useful information is rapidly declining as search becomes cluttered by Search Engine Optimization (SEO) results of poor relevence or quality, and the many commercial offerings that are just mediocre or more interested in your data than the servie they propose.

It takes time for people to learn about the limitations of commercial software.
Eventually people discover the limitations of their software either realizing that it is difficult or impossible to extract their data, or that the program or service is more interested in their data than providing the promoted service.

Free and open source software is the best longterm solution, despite perhaps not always containing the latest, fastest, or best set of features.

While PORG focuses on free software, there exist contraints that mean we sometimes do need propriatary software. PORG welcomes discussion all methodologies/software.

## Project 1 - A basic website

The PORG website uses a simply HTML but within a PHP wrapper that determines the date of the next PORG event (2nd monday of the month except in August).

The website:
- was developed in VIM (on Ubuntu)
- uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework for responsive layout
- is backed up and synchronized between development and production using [github](https://github.com/serialc/porg)

### Why use Ubuntu?
