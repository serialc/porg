## Inkscape

C presented the [Introduction to Inkscape slideshow](https://serialc.github.io/inkscape_poster_making_tutorial/inkscape_poster_making_tutorial.html#1) and then took questions.

### Questions
We covered how Inkscape can import and export PDFs with great ease.

We explored using the [connectors tool for flow diagrams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WtuUwx05Jo). This works quite well.

We also briefly played with gradients, showed how to add stops, and change the transparency.
