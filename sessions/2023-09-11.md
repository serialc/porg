# PORG #2

## Ubuntu and Arch linux

We discussed how Ubuntu and Arch are different 'layers' of sofware, with linux as the lowest level operating system.

In linux, operating systems are layers or sets of programs, that can be interchanged, for example, the desktop environment can be GNOME or KDE, while keeping the underlying system the same.

Ubuntu is a popular first choice for new linux users. It's full featured and stable. More proficient linux users may prefer alternative systems, such as Arch where they can easily customize their systems while having the latest software available.

## [MRAN is dead, long live GRAN](http://datacolada.org/108)

In discussing continuous integration, we mentioned how Microsoft used to provides a R package repository snaptshots, or past versions of packages, was ended the service on July 1, 2023. A new service has replaced it, named GRAN, using the [groundhog package](https://groundhogr.com/).

## Collaboration in document editing

Collaboration in the writing of articles is common for researchers. The 'old' strategy is to email back and forth a word document. This has benefits in that integration is easy, with the only problem that you have to focus work at specific times. Working in parallel with Word documents is also sometimes done but this is a nightmare to reintegrate.

Online alternatives exist. Such as Google Docs, Microsoft Teams, or Seafile, among many others. These work well, some better than others, but some of these don't satisfy the PORG principles of 'Open' software, except for [Seafile](https://www.seafile.com/). Seafile is software, but also an online platform running the service, that allows Google Drive and Docs fonctionality. You can install a server instance yourself.

Overleaf is also another good collaboration service, but for Latex documents. It requires the purchase of a licence for collaboration. 

## Data backup

Let the previous PORG session, we discussed again backing up, but within the uni.lu context of data storage and computing services.

The Univeristy of Luxembourg offers, at least, three data storage options, two of which are meant for use for working with the HPC.

For general storage the **atlas** server is available. It also allows group storage, for collaboration on projects. Atlas uses the the OneFS file system.

For those using the uni.lu HPC, the $HOME and /work/projects, and $SCRATCH storage should be familier. They use different filesystems, the GPFS and Lustre respectively, and have different capacity, permanance/purging, and prices if you were to exceed the /work/projects

Storage can be quite expensive. 

We had some unanswered questions during the meeting, such as:
- To SIU: Do we have a quota on Atlas?
- Do these apply to individual and/or group/project servers?

Connection to the drives is possible with Linux, OSX, and on Windows (using Samba).

## Backup and ownership of data for institutional safekeeping

- In different departments data is strongly maintained on institutional servers in case the researcher leaves ,and the gathering of the data was expensive and has great values.
- For others, little added value is created to data, and therefore there is not a strong 'data safekeeping' protocol.
- What are the protocols for leaving staff? Are there checks that leaving staff have backed up all their scientifically valuable data?
- While books or IT equipment is checked when leaving, there's no protocol for ensuring that all data created is also backed up in some institutions/departments.

## Discussion for next month's PORG

- Get SIU to present best practices on backing up your data, and backup services offered by the uni, such as Atlas.
    - However, it looks like there's info on the service portal that explains an [overview of backup storage internally and externally](https://service.uni.lu/kb?sys_kb_id=b50de8694755e15079de0b87536d43bf&id=kb_article_view&sysparm_rank=2&sysparm_tsqueryId=297e1125475df5103f41becd436d43f4) as well as how to do so on [different operating
    systems](https://service.uni.lu/kb?sys_kb_id=15532ab387d7811408a60e9c8bbb35be&id=kb_article_view&sysparm_rank=1&sysparm_tsqueryId=297e1125475df5103f41becd436d43f4).
- Ask HPC what their backup protocol is?
    - The [Quotas and Purging page](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/filesystems/quotas/) explains that for the data on the SCRATCH drive "**files that have not been read (i.e. atime has not been updated) within the last 60 days are automatically removed every month**".
    - The ULHPC [backup policy is well defined](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/data/backups/) as well.
