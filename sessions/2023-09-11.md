# PORG #2

## Ubuntu, Arch

- Layers of software that can be interchanged, e.g., GNOME, KDE
- Arch rolling release
- Arch core packages, or user or community packages.
- Updating and dependencies.
- Installation, sub-guides

## R
- Microsoft, MRAN, ended recently
- CRAN is the r library host for other OS?

## Collaboration in document editing
- Google docs
- LibreOffice is quite good, but sometimes slow for some.
- Overleaf

## Data backup
- Atlas, backup service for uni.lu
- HPC, [GPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPFS), 2,200 EUR per 10TB per year, but 1TB is free.
- Lustre, SCRATCH
- Move data from Isilon (Atlas), to scratch, then GPFS for HPC.

- atlas uses OneFS
- scratch uses Lustre
- HPC work/project uses GPFS

SIU - Do we have a quota on Atlas?
    - On the personal or group/project servers?

Use Samba to connect to Windows networked drives.

## Backup and ownership of data for institutional safekeeping
- In different departments data is strongly maintained on institutional servers in case the researcher leaves ,and the gathering of the data was expensive and has great values.
- For others, little added value is created to data, and therefore there is not a strong 'data safekeeping' protocol.
- Protocols for leaving staff, check that they have backed up all their data.
- While books or IT equipment is checked when leaving, there's no protocol for ensuring that all data created is also backed up.

## Next month
- SIU present best practices on backing up your data, and backup services offered by the uni, such as Atlas.
- Ask HPC what their backup protocol is.
