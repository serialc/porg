# PORG \#4

##  API and data scrapping

H presented his projects based on data collection from various sites.

His projects are:
- PreExtinction - project to predict species endagerment.
- TintedTales - Minority representation in American cinema. Using [Luminate](https://filmandtv.luminatedata.com/)

### Getting the data

Aside from analysis, the retrieval of data can be simple or complex. There's two main python tools used for gathering data:
- [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) allows much lower level control, requiring individual webpage components to be retrieved. It works well with cookies and is generally sufficient and lightweight enough when the target host isn't trying to make things difficult (or poorly designed).
- [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) is much more comprehensive. It connects to a website through a browser and allows better mimicking of a 'real' user. This is slower and more resource intensive as it downloads all the resources (e.g., images, libraries) rather than just the requested html target.

## Conclusion

We discussed how Selenium may be more taxing on the host website and slower than using Requests
, and therefore increase likelihood of blocking.
