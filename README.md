# Productivity Open Research Group (PORG)

The productivity open research group (PORG) is a monthly brown bag (lunchtime) meeting that invites participants to informally present and discuss how they perform effective research (or work) using their tools, such as, preferably, free/open software.

This site-specific project was replaced with [RizeMeet](https://github.com/serialc/rizemeet/) - a website framework.

[PORG now runs on RizeMeet](https://porg.digitaltwin.lu/)

## PORG transition

PORG was developed as a lightweight content management system (CMS) that would allow a minimal public face showing information about the next and past meeting sessions (i.e. minutes). PORG continued to evolve to make it easier to coordinate meetings, with new features being added, less reliance on command-line interaction, and a more comprehensive administrative GUI tool set.

Eventually it became clear that the PORG CMS would be useful for coordinating meetings on other issues. The content of PORG and the functionality were separated. Only the content of PORG remains here, and the CMS, named [RizeMeet](https://github.com/serialc/rizemeet/), has its own [repository](https://github.com/serialc/rizemeet/).
