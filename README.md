# Productivity Open Research Group (PORG)

The productivity open research group (PORG) is a monthly brown bag (lunchtime) meeting that invites participants to informally present and discuss how they perform effective research (or work) using their tools, such as, preferably, free/open software.

This site-specific project was replaced with [RizeMeet](https://github.com/serialc/rizemeet/) - a website framework.

[PORG no runs on RizeMeet](https://porg.digitaltwin.lu/)
